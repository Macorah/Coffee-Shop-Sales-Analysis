## üìä DATA SUMMARY
---
The dataset contains transactional records from a cafe, including details such as:
- Item purchased
- Quantity sold
- Total price
- Transaction date
- Payment method (e.g card, cash, or digital wallet)
- Service mode (e.g. takeaway, or in-store)

## Key observations from the analysis:
- Over 10,000 rows of data were imported, cleaned, and analyzed using SQL, Excel, and Power BI.
- Several records had missing or unrecorded payment methods, represented as "Not Available".
- The top-selling item by quantity was Juice, while January recorded the highest overall revenue.
- Excluding missing values, Credit Card was the most common payment method.
- Takeaway was the most frequently used service mode.

## üîç Recommendations
---
# Enhance Data Quality
- Implement mandatory logging for Payment_Method and Service_Mode fields to avoid "Not Available" entries.
- Apply data validation rules directly in the point-of-sale system to minimize user input errors.
# Leverage Seasonal Insights
-Investigate drivers behind the January revenue spike (e.g., promotions, holidays) and replicate those strategies in low-performing months.
# Optimize Inventory Management
-Prioritize stock and promotion of high-volume products like Juice to avoid shortages and maximize ROI.
# Payment Infrastructure
- Since Credit Card is the most preferred valid method, optimize and expand card payment channels (e.g., POS terminals, QR codes, or app payments).
